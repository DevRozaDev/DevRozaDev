### Welcome!
👋 Hello, I'm Robert Zaranek, a software/backend developer who strives to maintain a balance between development speed and codebase maintainability.\
This account functions as an archive/showcase of my past (or perhaps a snapshot of some *in-progress* ones) projects.\
All of this is maintained with recruiters in mind 💁

#### Professional interests
Currently, I'm interested in becoming a professional backend developer, my technology stack of choice includes either Elixir (I'm rather proficient in it already) or Golang (still learning). Relevant projects are showcased in my repositories.

#### A bit more about me
I live in Poland, in the Greater Poland Voivodeship.\
Outside of my professional interests I have a passion for game development, including game design and 🎨art.\
Other than that I enjoy cycling through natural environments in the ☀️warmer months of the year and playing 🎮video games (which sometimes turns into "research" for my other hobby😉).
