### Welcome!
👋 Hello, I'm Robert Zaranek, a software/backend developer who strives to maintain balance between development speed, performance and codebase maintainability.\
I use this account for both portfolio and professional development.

#### Professional interests
Currently, I'm working on Blockchain projects, my technology stack of choice includes Rust, but I also have experience in writing Elixir.

#### A bit more about me
I live in Poland, in the Greater Poland Voivodeship.\
Outside of my professional interests I have a passion for game development, including game design and 🎨art.\
Other than that I enjoy cycling through natural environments in the ☀️warmer months of the year and playing 🎮video games (which sometimes turns into "research" for my other hobby😉).
